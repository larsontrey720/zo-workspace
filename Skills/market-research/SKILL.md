## NAICS Codes

NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) is how the US government categorizes industries. Examples:
- 423990: Other Miscellaneous Durable Goods Merchant Wholesalers
- 336214: Travel Trailer and Camper Manufacturing
- 541511: Custom Computer Programming Services
- 722511: Full-Service Restaurants
- 44-45: Retail Trade (sector level)

Find codes: https://www.census.gov/naics/

## Examples

```bash
# Employment + wages for custom software development
python3 scripts/research.py industry 541511

# Establishment counts in California
python3 scripts/research.py establishments 541511 --state 06

# Search FRED for relevant series
python3 scripts/research.py fred-search "software industry output"

# Get GDP data
python3 scripts/research.py fred-data GDP --years 10

# Full market sizing report
python3 scripts/research.py sizing 541511
```

## Data Sources

- **BLS QCEW**: Quarterly employment and wages, updated quarterly. Most complete employment data by NAICS.
- **FRED**: 800,000+ economic time series. GDP, CPI, PPI, industry output, financial data. Real-time updates.
- **Census Bureau**: County Business Patterns (annual establishment counts), Economic Census (every 5 years, most recent 2022).

## Notes

- All government APIs are free. No usage limits worth worrying about.
- BLS data is quarterly with about a 6-month lag.
- Census CBP data is annual with about a 1-year lag.
- Economic Census data is every 5 years (2017, 2022). Latest 2022 data is available.
- The `sizing` command combines all three sources into a single markdown report.
- State FIPS codes: https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html
