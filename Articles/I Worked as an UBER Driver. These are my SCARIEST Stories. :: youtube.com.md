## Transcript

﻿My name is Daniel.
I drive for Uber in Oakland. I used to study engineering at Cal State East 
Bay. I liked statics and load calculations. I liked knowing how much weight a beam could 
hold before it failed. If something cracked, there was a reason. If a structure leaned, you 
could measure why. There was comfort in that. Driving nights in Oakland doesn’t work like that.
I usually log in around 8:00 PM and stay out until 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning. The money’s better 
after dark. Surge pricing hits around the bars near Lake Merritt. Airport runs stack up near 
Hegenberger Road. Late-night hospital pickups come in from Summit and Highland. If you know 
when to position yourself near International Boulevard or Broadway, you can make enough 
to cover rent and chip away at loans. But nights also mean you see everything.
I’ve been punched once on International near 42nd. A guy got in already angry, said I took too 
long even though I was there in three minutes. He

swung before I could say anything. Split my lip on 
the steering wheel. I finished the ride anyway. Someone tried to yank my door open at a red 
light near 73rd Avenue. I had it locked. He banged on the window with something 
metal and ran when traffic moved. A woman’s boyfriend leaned through my 
driver-side window outside a liquor store near Fruitvale BART and told me if I drove 
off without her, he’d follow me home. I waited. She got in. He didn’t follow.
One night outside Eastmont Mall, a kid no older than sixteen grabbed for my phone 
mount while I was stopped. I shoved him back and drove off before he got a grip.
It happens. You work anyway. Oakland at night is specific. International 
Boulevard smells like exhaust and fryer grease. Lake Merritt reflects red and blue police lights 
across the water after midnight. The stretch of

---

98th Avenue near the Coliseum turns empty 
after 1:30 AM except for warehouse workers and the occasional car creeping too slow.
Drivers talk. Not officially. Just small comments when you’re waiting in the airport 
queue or parked near a 24-hour gas station. Don’t idle in alleys off Edes Avenue.
Don’t accept pickup pins that land inside fenced industrial lots near the Port of Oakland.
Don’t circle Lake Merritt after midnight if the route loops twice.
And if you’re near 98th and you see trash piled near the curb at 
2:00 in the morning, cancel the ride. Most of it sounds like paranoia. Or superstition. 
Drivers work alone too long and start inventing patterns. I didn’t pay attention at first. If a 
pin showed up, I drove to it. If it paid surge, I kept it. Bills don’t care about rumors.
My coverage area is mostly East Oakland and

the lower hills. I take rides from West 
Oakland BART down to San Leandro Street. I’ve driven up Joaquin Miller Road more times 
than I can count. I’ve waited outside the Port of Oakland gates hoping for a decent freight worker 
tip. I’ve done airport runs from Hegenberger at three in the morning when the roads are empty 
and the Bay Bridge glows in the distance. You learn how to scan people fast. Shoes. Hands. 
Eyes in the rearview mirror. You notice who sits too close. Who breathes too heavy. Who 
won’t stop staring at the back of your head. I installed a dashcam after my 
second week. Interior and exterior. Not because of ghosts. Because of people.
The first time something didn’t make sense, I assumed I was tired. Long shifts will do 
that. When you drive twelve hours straight, the city starts to flatten. Streetlights 
blur. You replay the same blocks over and

over. Mandela Parkway looks the same at 11 
PM and 3 AM. The Port cranes look like metal skeletons against the sky. The water near 
Jack London Square sits black and still. There are normal dangers here. Robberies. 
Fights. Drunk passengers who throw up and argue about cleaning fees. That part I understand. 
You can measure that risk. You can calculate it. The other things don’t fit into numbers.
The first rule I broke was on 98th Avenue. It was 1:47 in the morning. I was idling near 
Hegenberger Road after an airport drop-off when a surge ping popped up. Pickup location: an alley 
off Edes Avenue, behind a row of auto body shops. Good fare. Close by.
I accepted it. That’s when I learned why drivers 
don’t stop near trash after 1:30 AM.

________
CASE ONE — The 98th Avenue Rule The pickup ping came through at 1:47 AM while 
I was stopped near the Chevron on Hegenberger Road. It was a short ride request with a 
decent surge attached. The pickup location sat just off 98th Avenue, down a narrow alley 
behind a row of auto body shops near Edes. I remember thinking it was easy money.
The alley wasn’t well lit. One wall was corrugated metal. The other was cinder 
block stained dark near the base from years of runoff. Three large green trash bins 
sat against the wall halfway down. A pile of black garbage bags was stacked beside them. No 
movement. No people waiting with phones out. I pulled forward slowly and stopped near the 
pickup pin. I put the car in park and turned on my hazards. The app showed the rider’s name, 
but I didn’t recognize it. No profile photo.

---

[6:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=371s)

I waited.
Thirty seconds passed. Then sixty. The alley was quiet except for the hum of 
my engine and a faint electrical buzz from a broken light fixture above one of the 
shop doors. The trash bags sat still. At ninety seconds, I leaned 
forward to check the map again. That’s when one of the garbage bags shifted.
It wasn’t wind. The air was still. The bag twitched from the inside, then settled. I stared 
at it for a few seconds, expecting a raccoon to burst out. Oakland has plenty of those.
The bag moved again. Slower this time. Like something 
inside it was adjusting its position. I reached to cancel the ride.
Before I could press the button, the lid of the nearest green trash bin lifted 
halfway up. Not fast. It rose steadily, like

---

[7:11](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=431s)

someone inside was pushing it with both hands.
Then something stood up behind it. At first I thought it was someone wearing 
a costume. It was bright green. Rounded at the shoulders. The surface looked soft, 
almost foam-like. Its head was large and oval-shaped with two wide, circular eyes that 
reflected my headlights without blinking. It straightened fully, clearing 
the top of the trash bin. The “skin” along its side had split at the 
seam near the ribs. Through the opening, I saw darker tissue underneath. Not 
fabric. Not stuffing. Something wet. A second shape rose from 
the pile of garbage bags. This one unfolded awkwardly, pushing plastic aside 
as it stood. It had the same bright green surface. Same wide mouth stretched too far across its face. 
When it opened that mouth, I saw rows of small,

---

[8:19](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=499s)

narrow teeth packed tightly together.
They didn’t rush me right away. The first one waddled forward two 
steps. Its legs moved stiff at the hips, then loosened. It adjusted to the pavement 
like it was getting used to standing upright. Then it sprinted.
It covered the distance between the trash bins and my rear bumper in less than two seconds.
The impact hit the trunk hard enough to shake the steering wheel in my hands. My rear camera 
flashed white for half a second, then went to static before returning to a distorted view.
The second one ran toward the passenger side. It slammed both hands against the rear window. 
Its face pressed flat against the glass. The green surface stretched thin around its teeth. 
I could see the seam splitting wider near its cheek. The plastic-looking eyes didn’t blink. They 
just stared directly through the glass at me.

---

[9:22](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=562s)

I shifted into drive and hit the gas.
The tires spun for a moment on loose gravel before catching. The first creature 
slid off the trunk. I heard something scrape across the metal as I accelerated.
I didn’t look back again until I hit the end of the alley.
I blew through the stop sign at 98th and turned onto Hegenberger without slowing. My hands 
were tight on the wheel. My heart was pounding hard enough that I could feel it in my neck.
I drove three blocks before checking the rearview.
The alley was empty. No one was chasing the car. No green 
shapes in the road. No movement at all. I kept driving until I reached the I-880 on-ramp. 
I pulled onto the shoulder just before merging and put the car in park.
I stepped out. The trunk had a shallow dent just left of center. 
Not deep, but visible even in low light. There was

---

[10:23](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=623s)

a smear across the paint. Thick. Dark green. 
It wasn’t paint transfer. It had texture. Small fibrous strands ran through it.
The smell hit me when I leaned closer. Bleach mixed with spoiled vegetables. Like a 
dumpster behind a grocery store in August. I wiped some of it with a napkin from my 
glove box. The residue stuck to the paper and left a streak across the clear coat.
I got back in the car and drove home. The next morning, in full daylight, the dent 
was still there. The green smear had dried and hardened along the edge. I tried to scrub it off 
at a self-serve wash on International Boulevard. It lightened, but it didn’t disappear completely.
There were faint scratch marks near the trunk latch. Four thin lines spaced evenly apart.
Claw marks.

---

[11:28](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=688s)

I checked the ride history in the app.
The pickup was marked “Canceled by Driver.” The rider’s name had disappeared. The pickup location 
no longer showed the alley behind the body shops. It now sat at the front curb on 98th.
I drove back that afternoon. The alley looked normal. Trash bins upright. 
Garbage bags stacked neatly. No damage. No dents in the bins. No green residue on the pavement.
I stood there for a minute, staring at the same spot where the first one had stood up.
A man from one of the shops stepped outside to smoke and asked if I needed 
something. I told him no and left. After that night, I stopped accepting any 
pickup where the pin landed inside an alley. If the dot sits behind a building instead 
of on the street, I cancel it immediately. And I don’t stop next to open trash piles 
on 98th Avenue after 1:30 in the morning.

---

[12:35](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=755s)

I don’t care how high the surge is.
_______ CASE TWO — The Lake Merritt Loop
The pickup came in at 12:32 AM on a Thursday. I had just dropped off two college kids near 
Grand Avenue and was idling along Lakeside Drive, facing the water. The lake was flat and dark, 
broken only by streaks of yellow and white from the apartment buildings across the way. 
A light wind pushed small ripples toward the concrete edge. A few people were still out 
walking, but most of the park had emptied. The request popped up less than a block away.
Pickup location: Lakeside Drive near the pergola. Rider name: Linda.
No profile photo. I accepted it and pulled forward under a 
streetlamp. The pergola sat just off the path, white columns glowing faintly under park 
lighting. A few benches lined the walkway.

---

[13:39](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=819s)

No one stood directly under the lamp.
Then I saw her walking up from the grass. She wasn’t running. She wasn’t waving. She just 
walked straight toward the car like she already knew which one was mine.
She was barefoot. Her hair was dark and wet, hanging in thin 
strands against her cheeks and neck. It wasn’t damp like sweat. It looked soaked. Her 
dress clung tightly to her legs and waist. No jacket. No purse. No shoes in her hands.
She opened the rear passenger door and slid in. The seat cushion made a soft 
sound under her weight. “Daniel?” she asked.
“Yeah,” I said. “You’re Linda?” She nodded once.
The destination on the app read: Grand Lake Theatre.
Easy ride. Around the lake, up Grand Avenue, two turns and done.
I pulled away from the curb and merged onto

---

[14:41](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=881s)

Lakeside Drive. The navigation arrow traced 
the edge of the water in a smooth curve. I checked the rearview mirror.
She sat upright, hands folded loosely in her lap. Her eyes weren’t on me. She 
stared out the window at the water sliding past. Her hair dripped occasionally onto the seat.
I heard it. A faint tap when droplets hit the vinyl.
“Long night?” I asked. She didn’t answer.
I figured she’d had a few drinks and didn’t want to talk. That wasn’t unusual.
As I passed the intersection near Bellevue Avenue, the navigation screen flickered.
The blue arrow marking my car froze in place, even though I was still moving. The rest 
of the map continued scrolling forward, but the route line disappeared. The destination 
box at the top of the screen went blank. No address. No turn instructions.
Just a spinning circle.

---

[15:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=945s)

I checked my signal bars. Full service.
I tapped the screen twice. Nothing changed. “App’s acting weird,” I said, half to myself.
No response from the back seat. I glanced up at the mirror.
The seat was empty. I hit the brakes hard enough that 
my seatbelt locked against my chest. The car behind me swerved around and laid on 
the horn. I steered toward the curb near a patch of grass and turned on my hazards.
I twisted around fully in my seat. The back door was closed.
The seatbelt strap hung loose, still slightly angled as if someone 
had just unbuckled it. The fabric of the seat was darker where she had been sitting.
I reached back and pressed my hand against it. Wet.
Not soaked, but clearly damp.

---

[16:45](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1005s)

I stepped out of the car and checked both sides.
No door closing sound. No footsteps on pavement. No splash from the water. The walkway 
behind me was empty except for a couple walking a dog about fifty yards away.
The lake itself looked undisturbed. I got back in and stared at the app.
The ride was still active. The timer continued counting upward. The 
destination field remained blank. No reroute. No cancellation notice.
I tapped “End Ride.” The screen froze for several seconds.
Then the ride completed automatically. One star appeared immediately. No message. No delay. Just the rating.
I sat there for a minute, engine idling, hazards blinking.
The back seat smelled faintly like lake water. Not chlorine. Not sewage. Just that 
specific smell of algae and concrete that hangs

---

[17:51](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1071s)

near the edge of Lake Merritt in summer.
I drove the rest of the night distracted. Every time I looked in the mirror, 
I expected to see her again. The next two days passed without incident. 
Normal rides. Normal people. A hospital nurse from Summit. A bartender heading home 
near Jack London Square. A couple arguing quietly in Spanish on International.
On Saturday night, I got home around 3:30 AM and turned on the TV while 
heating leftovers. KTVU was running a late-night segment about local cold cases.
The anchor introduced a story about a woman who had drowned in Lake Merritt three years earlier.
They showed footage of divers entering the water near the pergola. Yellow police 
tape strung between trees. Candles arranged along the railing.
Then they put her photo on screen. I stopped moving.
Dark hair. Narrow

---

[18:55](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1135s)

jawline. Small scar just above the left eyebrow.
The exact same scar I’d noticed in the mirror when she turned slightly toward the streetlight.
They switched to a driver’s license photo. It was clearer.
Same face. Same slight asymmetry in the mouth. Same thin nose. Same eyes.
I walked closer to the television. The report said she had left a bar near Grand 
Avenue just before midnight. Friends said she seemed fine. She never made it home. Her body 
was recovered two days later from the lake. Cause of death: drowning.
They displayed her full name. Linda Philips. 
I muted the TV and stood there for a long time. The back seat of my car still smelled 
faintly damp the next morning. I drove back to Lakeside Drive 
in daylight and parked nearby.

---

[19:57](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1197s)

Joggers passed. A couple pushed a stroller 
along the path. The lake looked harmless. I stared at the spot where 
she had stepped into my car. No signs. No markers. No memorial plaque.
Just concrete and water. Since that night, I don’t complete full 
loops around Lake Merritt after midnight. If the route circles the water twice, I reroute 
manually through Grand Avenue or cut over toward Broadway. If a pickup pin lands too close to 
the pergola late at night, I let it expire. I’ve been mugged in this city. I’ve been 
punched in the face by a drunk stranger. I’ve had someone threaten to follow me home.
Those are real dangers. You can see them coming. None of those people vanished 
without opening a door. And none of them left a one-star 
rating after they were already dead. _____
CASE THREE — The Construction Worker

---

[21:00](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1260s)

The pickup came in at 5:10 AM on a Tuesday.
That’s the quiet hour. The bars are closed. The overnight hospital traffic slows down. The sky is 
still dark, but there’s a gray line forming over the hills. Most of the rides at that time 
are airport runs or early shift workers. The request came from Mandela 
Parkway near West Grand Avenue. Rider name: Carlos.
No profile photo. I accepted it and pulled up along the curb 
beside a stretch of industrial fencing. A row of shipping containers sat across the 
street. A semi-truck idled two blocks down. He was already standing there when I arrived. Hard hat in one hand. Reflective 
vest over a long-sleeve shirt. Work boots dusted white around the toes. He 
looked like he had been up for hours. He opened the back door and got in.
“Morning,” he said. “Morning,” I answered. “Headed to work?”
“Yeah,” he said. “Early shift.”

---

[22:07](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1327s)

The app showed the destination as an 
address near the Port of Oakland. A chemical processing facility on the edge of the 
industrial zone, just off Middle Harbor Road. I’d driven that direction before, but 
I didn’t remember that specific plant. He buckled his seatbelt carefully 
and rested his hard hat on his lap. “You drive nights?” he asked.
“Mostly,” I said. He nodded.
“That’s rough,” he said. “I used to do graveyard shifts. Hard on your body.”
His voice was steady. Calm. Friendly in a tired way.
We merged onto West Grand and headed toward I-880. The freeway was nearly empty. A few 
headlights in the distance. The cranes at the Port rose up like black shapes against the fading sky.
“How long you been doing construction?” I asked. “Long enough,” he said with a 
small smile. “Pays the bills.”

---

[23:10](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1390s)

He told me about early morning concrete 
pours. About how the air smells different near the water before sunrise. About how he liked 
getting work done before the city fully woke up. It felt normal.
That’s the part that sticks with me. There was nothing wrong with him.
No strange smell. No odd breathing. No strange pauses in conversation.
Just a guy heading to work. As we exited the freeway and moved 
deeper into the industrial area, the roads grew narrower. Warehouses lined both 
sides. Chain-link fences topped with barbed wire. Security cameras mounted on poles.
The address was about a mile ahead. “You ever get weird riders at night?” he asked.
“Sometimes,” I said. “Drunk people mostly.” He nodded slowly.
“Yeah. I bet.” There was a pause.
Then he added, “It’s

---

[24:15](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1455s)

always nice to talk to good people.”
I glanced at him in the mirror. He was looking straight ahead, not at me.
We turned onto the final road. The address was coming up on the right.
Except there was no building. I slowed down.
The app’s blue arrow pointed directly to a stretch of cracked 
concrete behind a rusted chain-link fence. No facility.
No lights. No structure at all.
Just an empty lot covered in weeds and debris. I pulled to the curb and put the car in park.
“This doesn’t look right,” I said. “Is the address correct?”
I turned around. The back seat was empty.
The hard hat was gone. The seatbelt strap hung loose, still angled 
across the seat as if it had just been unlatched. I stepped out of the car.
The fence had a sign bolted to it.

---

[25:18](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1518s)

Facility Closed — Chemical Accident.
Unauthorized Entry Prohibited Below that, smaller text listed the year.
Six years ago. The name of the plant was printed at the top.
It matched the destination in the app. I walked closer to the fence and looked inside.
The concrete foundation was cracked and blackened in places. Metal beams lay twisted near 
the far end of the lot. Nothing stood taller than my waist.
The app chimed softly. Ride complete.
Five-star rating. A tip notification followed seconds later.
I got back in the car and stared at the back seat.
Dry. No dirt. No footprints. No water.
I picked up my phone and searched the plant name. The first result was a news article.
Explosion at Chemical Facility

---

[26:20](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1580s)

Near Port of Oakland
Eight Workers Killed The article was dated six years earlier.
There was a group photo attached. Construction crew standing in front of 
the plant months before the accident. I zoomed in.
Third man from the left. Hard hat tilted slightly back. 
Same dark hair. Same square jaw. Carlos. I sat there with the engine idling.
Traffic began to pick up as the sky lightened. A delivery truck passed 
behind me. The driver didn’t look twice. I checked the ride receipt in the app.
Pickup: Mandela Parkway. Drop-off: [Plant Address].
Time: 5:10 AM – 5:31 AM. Rating: ★★★★★
Tip: $8.00 No glitches. No missing data.
Everything documented cleanly.

---

[27:25](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1645s)

I drove back toward the freeway slowly.
Halfway up the on-ramp, I glanced in the rearview mirror again.
Empty. I’ve had passengers disappear before.
But this one thanked me. “It’s always nice to talk to good people.”
The next time I drove past that stretch of road, I didn’t look at the empty lot.
I kept my eyes forward and stayed in my lane. Some riders don’t need a ride 
to get where they’re going. They just need someone to talk to on the way.
_______ CASE FOUR — The Blood Bank Ride
The pickup came in at 1:18 AM on a Sunday. Location: International 
Boulevard near 14th Avenue. That stretch stays active late. Liquor stores 
with metal grates halfway down. A taco truck shutting off its burners. A bus idling at the stop 
with no passengers getting on. The streetlights

---

[28:29](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1709s)

throw yellow light over everything, and the 
pavement always looks wet even when it isn’t. The rider’s name was Victor.
No profile photo. I pulled up in front of a closed 
discount store. The security gate was down. The sidewalk was mostly empty.
He stepped out from behind the bus bench. He moved slowly. Not injured. 
Not unsteady. Just deliberate. He opened the rear passenger door 
and got in without hesitation. “Daniel?” he asked.
“Yeah.” He shut the door gently.
The smell hit almost immediately. Rot.
Not garbage rot. Not sour milk. Something heavier. Thicker.
Underneath it was the metallic scent of blood. Fresh iron. The kind you taste 
when you bite the inside of your cheek.

---

[29:30](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1770s)

It filled the cabin in seconds. The destination in the app read: 
BloodSource Donation Center on Broadway. Open 24 hours.
I pulled back into traffic. In the rearview mirror, I 
got a clear look at him. His skin was pale in a way that didn’t 
match the lighting. Not just light. It looked stretched tight across his cheekbones. 
His lips were thin and almost gray. His hair was combed straight back, dry and flat.
He wasn’t looking out the window. He wasn’t looking at the dashboard.
He was staring directly at the back of my head. “You heading to donate?” I asked.
He didn’t answer. Instead, he smiled.
Slowly. His teeth were small and evenly 
spaced. Too even. Too clean. The grin didn’t reach his eyes.
We passed 19th Avenue. The

---

[30:36](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1836s)

car felt smaller than usual. 
The smell of rot stayed steady. He leaned forward slightly.
Just an inch. The distance between his 
face and my headrest closed. In the mirror, his eyes didn’t blink.
Not once. At the next red light near 23rd Avenue, 
I watched his reflection carefully. His chest wasn’t rising.
There was no visible breathing. Instead, the muscles in his throat 
pulsed once every few seconds. A slow contraction under the skin.
He leaned closer again. Another inch.
I adjusted my seat forward slightly without making it obvious.
His grin widened. We drove in silence for another block.
I felt his eyes fixed on the back of my skull. The light ahead turned yellow.
And I braked hard.

---

[31:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1897s)

Something slid off the dashboard 
and dropped into my lap. The silver necklace my grandmother 
gave me when I was a kid. Thin chain. Small pendant. Plain silver.
I usually keep it resting near the base of the windshield.
It had shifted forward when I stopped. I picked it up without thinking.
The metal felt cool in my hand. I lifted it and hooked it 
over the rearview mirror. The chain swung gently in front of the glass.
In the mirror, his reaction was immediate. The grin vanished.
His eyes shifted. Not to me.
To the necklace. His body stiffened against the seatback.
The smell of rot didn’t disappear, but it changed.
It thinned. His jaw tightened.
“Let me out,” he said.

---

[32:37](https://youtube.com/watch?v=6a7tDPmyTOA&t=1957s)

We were still three blocks 
from the blood bank but I didn’t argue.
I unlocked the doors. He moved fast.
The door opened before the car fully stopped rolling.
He stepped out onto the sidewalk without looking back.
The door shut firmly. I checked the mirror.
He was already halfway down the block, walking quickly toward a darker stretch of Broadway.
I drove the remaining distance to the blood bank anyway.
The building was lit up. A security guard stood inside the glass 
doors. Two cars were parked in the lot. No one matching his description 
was walking toward it. The ride completed automatically in the app.
No rating. No tip.
No complaint. When I got home, I left the 
necklace hanging from the mirror. I haven’t taken it down since.
I don’t know what he was. I only know that when he saw that 
silver necklace, he wanted out.

________________
CASE FIVE — The Port of Oakland This one happened at 2:54 AM on a Wednesday.
I was parked near Jack London Square after dropping off a couple from Uptown when 
the request came in. Surge was high near the Port. Pickup location sat inside the 
container yard off Middle Harbor Road. That’s unusual. Most port workers 
meet rides outside the gate. I almost declined it.
Then I saw the fare. I accepted.
The road toward the Port is wide and mostly empty that time of night. The cranes stand 
still over the water. Floodlights wash everything in hard white light. Stacks of containers 
rise like metal buildings on both sides. The app directed me to Gate 4.
The guard booth light was on. No guard inside.
The gate arm lifted automatically as I approached.
I didn’t scan anything. It just went up.
That should have been enough to turn around.

Instead, I drove through.
The route took me down a narrow service lane between container 
stacks. My headlights reflected off red, blue, and gray steel walls on both sides.
The pickup pin sat ahead near a red container. Three trash bins were lined up against it.
Green lids. One slightly tilted.
I stopped twenty feet away. No worker.
No hard hat. No movement.
Then I smelled it. Bleach.
Sharp and chemical. Underneath it, spoiled vegetables. Sour and heavy. 
Like produce left sealed in plastic too long. The exact same smell from 98th Avenue.
My stomach tightened. The rear camera flickered on without me shifting.
The image shook for a second. The trunk alert lit up.
TRUNK OPEN.

I hadn’t touched the release.
In the rearview mirror, the back seat was empty. In the camera feed, the trunk 
lid was raised halfway. Something green unfolded from inside.
This one was big. Its surface was the same foam-like 
green texture. The seam along its side split wider as it stretched. Dark 
interior tissue showed through the tear. It braced itself against the trunk frame.
The smell intensified. Bleach and rot filled the cabin.
Its mouth opened sideways along the seam. Rows of small, tightly 
packed teeth flexed outward. The camera glitched white.
The trunk slammed shut. The dashboard still read:
TRUNK OPEN. I didn’t hesitate.
I threw the car into drive and hit the gas.

The service lane ended at the exit gate.
The gate arm was down. No guard.
I didn’t slow. The bumper hit the gate hard enough to snap 
it free. The arm scraped across the windshield and flipped off to the side.
I turned onto Middle Harbor Road and accelerated toward I-880.
In the rearview mirror, nothing followed. But the smell stayed.
Bleach. Rot.
It filled the car like something was still inside.
The trunk alert flickered twice and disappeared. I didn’t slow until I was on 
the freeway heading north. Three exits up, I pulled onto 
the shoulder near High Street. The smell faded slightly when I stopped.
I stepped out and walked to the back of the car. The trunk was open. 
Empty. Spare tire. Jack. Emergency kit.
But there was a small section of green residue.

And I could see claw marks. 
The lining smelled like cleaning chemicals and sour produce.
The app showed: Rider Unavailable — Ride Canceled.
No rating. No profile.
Just gone. _____
CASE SIX — The Airport Pickup The last story happened just after 
midnight at Oakland International. Airport rides are usually simple. You sit in the 
designated queue, wait for the app to assign you, and pull to the curb when the passenger walks 
out. Most of the time it’s business travelers with rolling suitcases or college 
kids coming home for the weekend. This one was from Terminal 1.
Rider name: William. No profile photo.
I pulled into the pickup lane under the blue “Rideshare” sign. Automatic 
doors slid open and shut behind a stream of passengers. A few people stood around checking 
their phones. A Southwest flight had just landed.

He walked out alone.
Early twenties. Short dark hair. Clean-shaven. No luggage. He wore 
jeans and a black Def Leppard jacket, the logo across the back faded and cracked from age.
He spotted my car and gave a small wave. “Daniel?” he asked as he opened the back door.
“Yeah.” He slid into the seat and 
shut the door carefully. “Appreciate you picking me 
up this late,” he said. “No problem,” I answered. “San Leandro?”
“Yeah,” he said. “Near Washington Avenue.” The address matched the one in the app.
We pulled away from the curb and merged onto Hegenberger Road. The airport lights 
receded behind us. The road was mostly empty. “You coming back home?” I asked.
“Yeah,” “Been a while.” he said. He leaned back in the seat, looking out 
the window at the passing streetlights.

“So how was your flight?” I asked.
He didn’t answer. Instead, he said, “How long you been driving?”
“Couple years,” I said. “Mostly nights.” “That’s steady work,” he replied.
His voice stayed calm. Friendly. He asked if I liked it. I told him it paid 
the bills. He nodded like that made sense. We merged onto I-880 northbound. 
Traffic was light. The freeway hummed under the tires. The Port cranes 
stood dark against the sky to our right. He asked about my favorite late-night food spots 
in East Oakland. I told him about a taco stand near East 14th that stayed open late. He smiled.
“Man,” he said quietly. “I missed that.” We exited toward San Leandro and followed the 
app’s directions through a quiet neighborhood.

Single-story houses. Porch lights 
glowing softly. Lawns cut short. “Hey that’s it,” he said, pointing 
ahead. “Blue house on the left.” I slowed and pulled to the curb in front 
of a small house with a trimmed hedge and a narrow driveway. A streetlight 
cast a pale glow over the lawn. I shifted into park.
“We’re here,” I said. No answer.
I glanced at the rearview mirror. The seat was empty.
I turned around fully in my seat. The back door was closed. The seatbelt lay 
flat against the cushion. No one there. My heart kicked once, hard.
I opened the driver’s door and stepped out onto the street.
The night air felt cooler than before. I walked around to the back 
passenger door and opened it. Empty.
But something was lying across the seat.

The black Def Leppard jacket.
I reached in and picked it up. It was hot.
I dropped it instinctively and let it fall onto the pavement.
As it hit the ground, I noticed holes burned through the fabric near the 
shoulder and lower back. Not torn. Burned. Edges blackened and stiff.
I scratched the back of my head, trying to make sense of it.
The front door of the blue house opened. An older man stepped out. He wore jeans and 
a gray T-shirt. He looked at me calmly. “Everything alright?” he asked. 
“Yeah,” I said automatically. Then I paused. I looked down at the jacket on the street.
“Sir,” I said, “you ever feel like you’ve seen a ghost?”
He didn’t laugh. He stepped off the porch and walked 
toward the curb. He bent down and

picked up the jacket carefully.
He looked at the back first. His expression changed.
He turned it over and checked the tag near the collar.
His fingers trembled slightly. “My son used to have a jacket 
just like this,” he said quietly. He looked closer at the name 
written inside the tag. William Price Jr.
He didn’t say anything for a long moment. Neither did I.
“He was twenty-two,” the old man said. “Plane crash. Twenty-three 
years ago. Flight out of Oakland.” He kept staring at the name on the tag.
I didn’t know what to say. We talked briefly. The older 
man’s name was William. After a minute or two…
I got back into my car and closed

the door gently. He kept his son’s jacket. 
The ride in the app showed completed. Five-star rating.
As I pulled away from the curb, I looked once more in the mirror.
I think… well I think he just wanted to go home. _____
I don’t drive nights anymore. I tried switching to daytime shifts for 
a few weeks. Airport runs in the morning. Office commuters downtown. Grocery store 
pickups in Alameda. It felt different with the sun out. The city looked smaller. Manageable.
But it didn’t change what had already happened. Every time someone got in the back 
seat, I checked the mirror twice. Every time I smelled something out of 
place, my hands tightened on the wheel. Every time the app froze for half a second 
longer than usual, my stomach dropped. So I stopped.
I sold the car to a guy in Hayward who didn’t ask many questions. Cleared what I owed on 
it. Took a job that keeps me inside most days.

I still drive sometimes, just not for strangers.
I don’t go near 98th Avenue at night. I don’t circle Lake Merritt after dark. 
I don’t take calls from the Port. And I don’t sit in airport queues past midnight.
I keep the silver necklace hanging from the mirror in my new car. I don’t leave it on the dashboard 
anymore. It stays up where I can see it. Some nights, when I’m stopped at a light, 
I still check the back seat out of habit. It’s always empty.
But every now and then, when I pass a trash bin sitting too close to the 
curb, or when I drive by Lake Merritt and see the water sitting flat under the streetlights, or 
when a plane flies low overhead on approach to Oakland International, I think about the 
rides I finished and the ones I didn’t. I think about the construction worker 
who just wanted to talk before work. I think about the woman who 
never made it out of the lake.

I think about the the thing that grinned in 
the mirror until silver swung between us. And I think about William Price Jr. Twenty-two years old.
Twenty-three years gone. Oakland has real danger. Real violence. 
Real reasons to keep your doors locked. But sometimes the rider gets out before you stop.
Sometimes the back seat empties without a sound. And sometimes, I think, they’re 
just trying to get back home.
