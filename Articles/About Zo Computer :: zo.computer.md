Computers are the most flexible tools ever invented.

And yet most software is built generically for millions of users, meaning it's not ideal for anyone. Companies have to split the difference, building generic monolithic solutions that work at scale. At the same time, individuals can't make custom tools because it requires **expert knowledge** that takes years to acquire.

AI changes this. When expertise is accessible and infrastructure is personal, custom software becomes a real option for everyone. Today, most people experience software through **features** - pre-built pieces meant to deliver value while concealing complexity. But when expertise stops being the bottleneck, the primitive shifts back to what it should be: **the computer itself**.

Zo is an **intelligent cloud computer**. Because it is just a computer, it is endlessly malleable. Rather than hiding complexity, Zo makes expert knowledge accessible and transparent through language. Having personal software doesn't just mean we'll use better tools; when we have agency over our digital environment, it changes how we think. Knowing that we can change anything is intoxicating.

We believe Zo represents **a new category of personal computer**. Having an intelligent server in the future will be as common as having a smartphone is today. Smartphones put the internet in our pockets, while servers allow us to **be the internet**. When everyone can **own their own home on the internet**, we'll have more authority over our privacy, more influence over our tools, and richer interactions with the rest of the internet.

As this happens, *the internet itself* will start to feel very different: more vibrant, more dynamic, and more personal.
