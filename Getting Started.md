Welcome to Zo, your powerful cloud companion. 

Here's how to get started:

## [1. Add files](/push?t=files) to your workspace

You can use Zo as cloud storage, take notes, transcribe audio, generate images, and more. And you can chat with AI to work with any kind of file.

*Download the Zo desktop app to sync files to your Zo.*

## [2. Use integrations](/push?t=settings&s=integrations) to connect the tools you use. 

Try texting or emailing Zo to ask questions or build projects.

*If there's an integration we don't support, try asking Zo to build a custom integration. Zo can write and run code, so nearly anything is possible.*

## [3. Save an article](/push?action=save_article&action_url=https://www.zo.computer/blog/from-personal-computer-to-personal-civilization) to your knowledge base.

If you send Zo a URL in the chat (or using text or email), Zo will automatically save the article.

*Zo comes with many powerful web tools. For example, Zo will automatically grab the transcript from YouTube videos. Zo can search for Google Maps locations, Twitter trends, people, and much more. All the tools your AI has access to are listed in our [documentation](https://docs.zocomputer.com/tools).* 

## [4. Create a scheduled task,](/push?t=agents) your first AI automation.

You can ask Zo to do anything on a schedule. For example, try asking Zo to send you a daily news summary, on a topic of your choice.

*By default, scheduled tasks will not notify you, but you can ask Zo to email or text you if you'd like. You can also try asking Zo to notify you conditionally: "text me only if this product is on sale"*

## [5. Create a site,](/push?action=create_site) hosted on Zo.

You can vibe code sites, data analysis, and other tools using Zo. Because your Zo is your personal server, hosting what you build is easy – it comes built-in.
