## Key Findings

### High Opportunity Targets

**No Website (7 businesses):**
These are the easiest leads - they need a website built from scratch.

**Broken Websites (6 businesses):**
These businesses thought they had a web presence but their sites are down. Great opportunity to offer website repair/rebuild services.

### Common Security Issues

Most working websites are missing critical security headers:
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):** Forces HTTPS connections
- **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Prevents XSS attacks
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevents clickjacking

### WordPress Vulnerabilities

Several sites expose their WordPress admin panels, making them vulnerable to:
- Brute force login attacks
- Plugin vulnerability exploitation
- Theme-based attacks

## Notes

- Business data sourced from Google Maps searches across the UK
- Website checks performed from a US server - some UK sites may have geo-blocking
- "WordPress admin exposed" means wp-admin/wp-login pages are publicly accessible
- Connection errors may be due to temporary downtime or geo-restrictions
